# 👋 **Welcome to my GitHub!**  

## 🚀 **Build, Learn, Grow**  

Self-taught and passionate about web development since my teenage years, I've always been driven by curiosity—understanding how things work, experimenting, and creating. **Code is just a means**, what truly matters is the impact of the solutions it enables.  

My **non-traditional path** — 12 years in **management and sales** before becoming a developer — gives me a vision that extends beyond just writing code: **understanding a need, designing a solid architecture, and delivering an efficient, scalable solution.**  

💡 **I love solving complex problems with simple, effective solutions.**  

## 🔹 **Building Meaningful Solutions**  

Development is more than writing code—it's about designing, structuring, and **creating high-performance tools**.  

✔️ **Architecture & Scalability** → Building robust and maintainable solutions  
✔️ **User Experience** → A great product is, above all, **intuitive**  
✔️ **Performance & SEO** → Fast, accessible, and well-optimized solutions  

**Seeing an idea turn into a product that people use is what drives me.**  

## 💻 **Stack & Interests**  

🛠️ **Tech Stack**: React, TypeScript, NestJS, Prisma, SQL/NoSQL, Docker  
📈 **Focus Areas**: Web performance, SEO, distributed architectures  
🎯 **Vision**: Creating solutions that are **easy to use and evolve over time**  

**Learning and tackling new challenges is part of my DNA.**

## 📚 **Always Curious, Always Learning**  

Development is a **never-ending learning journey**. **I love exploring, experimenting, and sharing** my findings.  

Outside of tech, I’m into **retrogaming**, **collaborative applications**, and open-source solutions that simplify everyday life.
